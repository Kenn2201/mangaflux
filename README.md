## Current release

**v1.2.1 — Profile Editing & Mobile Modal Polish**

MangaFlux V1 remains a stable single-source MangaDex product. v1.2.1 polishes the first Profiles & Community Depth release with an explicit edit workflow and reliable mobile profile-modal return behavior.

### Library improvements

- Library filter/search by title
- switch between All / Bookmarks / History
- sort by recent activity, title, or reading progress
- larger account/device library summaries for real library browsing
- remove one manga from reading history
- clear reading history while preserving bookmarks
- destructive history actions require confirmation

### Reader settings

Each manga can keep per-series reader preferences with signed-in account synchronization and browser-local fallback:

- preferred chapter language
- Data Saver
- preferred scanlation group
- whether alternate scanlation releases are shown
- image fit: Fit width or Fit screen
- page spacing: Seamless, Small gap, or Large gap
- reader UI text size: Small, Standard, or Large

The settings sheet is available from manga chapter lists and inside the immersive reader.

### Chapter quality

- chapter lists respect the selected language
- direct chapter jump respects the selected language
- previous/next reader navigation respects the selected language
- duplicate chapter-number releases are collapsed by default
- collapsed duplicates prefer the selected scanlation group when available
- scanlation group attribution remains visible
- an alternate-release count is shown when duplicates are collapsed
- readers can opt back into all alternate releases

### v1.2.1 refinements

- community profile settings are read-only by default
- Edit profile explicitly enters the editable state
- Save profile returns the card to read-only mode
- Cancel discards draft edits and restores the saved profile state
- mobile public-profile modals preserve the exact underlying scroll position when opened and closed
- closing a public profile restores focus without scrolling the manga/comment page
- v1.2.0 bio, privacy, manga navigation, and v1.1.x reader behavior remain unchanged

### Architecture boundary

V1 remains MangaDex-only. MangaFlux does not bypass anti-bot protections, CAPTCHAs, paywalls, or login walls, and does not mirror manga page binaries into MangaFlux persistence.

## Branch workflow

MangaFlux uses one persistent development branch and does not create temporary version/work branches.

Keep all release work on `kenn/develop`. Consolidate the release there, open one complete PR to `main`, merge only after CI passes, then reset `kenn/develop` to the merged `main` head.

See `docs/ROADMAP.md` for the canonical 1.x / 2.x / 3.x roadmap.
