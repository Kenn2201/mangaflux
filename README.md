## Current release

**v1.4.7 — Personalization Depth**

MangaFlux V1 remains a stable single-source MangaDex product. After v1.4.6 Genre Preferences passed physical QA, v1.4.7 completes the planned v1.4.x personalization depth with a device-local manga-status preference plus distinct improved Hot, Popular, and Trending discovery rankings.

### Library improvements

- Library filter/search by title
- switch between All / Bookmarks / History
- sort by recent activity, title, or reading progress
- larger account/device library summaries for real library browsing
- remove one manga from reading history
- clear reading history while preserving bookmarks
- destructive history actions require confirmation

### Reader settings

Each manga can keep per-series reader preferences with signed-in account synchronization and browser-local fallback:

- preferred chapter language
- Data Saver
- preferred scanlation group
- whether alternate scanlation releases are shown
- image fit: Fit width or Fit screen
- page spacing: Seamless, Small gap, or Large gap
- reader UI text size: Small, Standard, or Large

The settings sheet is available from manga chapter lists and inside the immersive reader.

### Chapter quality

- chapter lists respect the selected language
- direct chapter jump respects the selected language
- previous/next reader navigation respects the selected language
- duplicate chapter-number releases are collapsed by default
- collapsed duplicates prefer the selected scanlation group when available
- scanlation group attribution remains visible
- an alternate-release count is shown when duplicates are collapsed
- readers can opt back into all alternate releases

### v1.4.7 refinements

- v1.4.6 Genre Preferences passed physical QA and is signed off
- readers can optionally prefer Ongoing, Completed, Hiatus, or Cancelled manga on the current device
- preferred status personalizes Hot, Popular, Trending, and the preferred-genre rail
- MangaFlux Hot is freshness-led, reinforced by popularity, and boosts titles strong in both signals
- Popular keeps follow popularity dominant while adding a bounded freshness signal
- Trending is a new discovery category that prioritizes titles strong in both popularity and recent chapter activity
- Browse supports Trending alongside Hot, Popular, Top rated, and Latest
- Discovery language and preferred status remain independent
- no new database migration is required

## Branch workflow

MangaFlux uses one persistent development branch and does not create temporary version/work branches.

Keep all release work on `kenn/develop`. Consolidate the release there, open one complete PR to `main`, merge only after CI passes, then reset `kenn/develop` to the merged `main` head.

See `docs/ROADMAP.md` for the canonical 1.x / 2.x / 3.x roadmap.
