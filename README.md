## Current release

**v1.2.2 — Activity Browsing & Discussion UX**

MangaFlux V1 remains a stable single-source MangaDex product. v1.2.2 deepens public activity browsing and makes manga/chapter discussions easier to navigate without crossing into the separate Following & Notifications phase.

### Library improvements

- Library filter/search by title
- switch between All / Bookmarks / History
- sort by recent activity, title, or reading progress
- larger account/device library summaries for real library browsing
- remove one manga from reading history
- clear reading history while preserving bookmarks
- destructive history actions require confirmation

### Reader settings

Each manga can keep per-series reader preferences with signed-in account synchronization and browser-local fallback:

- preferred chapter language
- Data Saver
- preferred scanlation group
- whether alternate scanlation releases are shown
- image fit: Fit width or Fit screen
- page spacing: Seamless, Small gap, or Large gap
- reader UI text size: Small, Standard, or Large

The settings sheet is available from manga chapter lists and inside the immersive reader.

### Chapter quality

- chapter lists respect the selected language
- direct chapter jump respects the selected language
- previous/next reader navigation respects the selected language
- duplicate chapter-number releases are collapsed by default
- collapsed duplicates prefer the selected scanlation group when available
- scanlation group attribution remains visible
- an alternate-release count is shown when duplicates are collapsed
- readers can opt back into all alternate releases

### v1.2.2 refinements

- public profiles can browse paginated comment activity beyond the initial recent-comment preview
- public-activity pagination rechecks the server-side privacy setting before returning activity
- manga/chapter discussions can switch between Newest and Oldest ordering
- posting a new comment returns the discussion to Newest so the new post is immediately visible
- deleting the final comment on a page safely moves back to the previous available page
- signed-in readers see a clear You badge on their own comments
- reaction totals and the reader's selected reaction are summarized with accessible live status
- v1.2.1 profile editing and mobile modal scroll restoration remain unchanged

### Architecture boundary

V1 remains MangaDex-only. MangaFlux does not bypass anti-bot protections, CAPTCHAs, paywalls, or login walls, and does not mirror manga page binaries into MangaFlux persistence.

## Branch workflow

MangaFlux uses one persistent development branch and does not create temporary version/work branches.

Keep all release work on `kenn/develop`. Consolidate the release there, open one complete PR to `main`, merge only after CI passes, then reset `kenn/develop` to the merged `main` head.

See `docs/ROADMAP.md` for the canonical 1.x / 2.x / 3.x roadmap.
